His parents were \\nvery hard- working and deeply religious people, but so poor \\nthat they lived with their five children in only two rooms. \\nThe father and mother spent their evenings in reading aloud \\nto their children, generally from books of a serious charac -\\nter.\\nThough always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out \\nthird in the final examination of the Petersburg school of \\nEngineering. There he had already begun his first work, \\n‘Poor Folk.’\\nThis story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his \\nreview and was received with acclamations. The shy, un -\\nknown youth found himself instantly something of a \\ncelebrity. A brilliant and successful career seemed to open \\nbefore him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he \\nwas arrested.\\nThough neither by temperament nor conviction a revolu -\\ntionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men \\nwho met together to read Fourier and Proudhon. He was ac -\\ncused of ‘taking part in conversations against the censorship, \\nof reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing \\nof the intention to set up a printing press.’ Under Nicholas I.

After eight \\nmonths’ imprisonment he was with twenty-one others tak -\\nen out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot. Writing to his \\nbrother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: ‘They snapped words over \\nour heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by \\npersons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in \\nthrees to stakes, to suffer execution. Being the third in the \\nrow, I concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me. \\nI thought of you and your dear ones and I contrived to kiss \\nPlestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to bid \\nthem farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were \\nunbound, brought back upon the scaffold, and informed \\nthat his Majesty had spared us our lives.’ The sentence was \\ncommuted to hard labour.\\nOne of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he \\nwas untied, and never regained his sanity.\\nThe intense suffering of this experience left a lasting \\nstamp on Dostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper \\nled him in the end to accept every suffering with resignation \\nand to regard it as a blessing in his own case, he constantly \\nrecurs to the subject in his writings. He describes the awful \\nagony of the condemned man and insists on the cruelty of \\ninflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal \\nservitude, spent in the company of common criminals in \\nSiberia, where he began the ‘Dead House,’ and some years \\nof service in a disciplinary battalion.\\nHe had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease be -\\nfore his arrest and this now developed into violent attacks of ', metadata={'source': 'pdf\\\\crime-and-punishment.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The \\nfits occurred three or four times a year and were more fre -\\nquent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was allowed to \\nreturn to Russia. He started a journal— ‘Vremya,’ which was \\nforbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. \\nIn 1864 he lost his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was \\nin terrible poverty, yet he took upon himself the payment \\nof his brother’s debts. He started another journal—‘The Ep -\\noch,’ which within a few months was also prohibited. He \\nwas weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was depen -\\ndent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, \\nand is said never to have corrected his work. The later years \\nof his life were much softened by the tenderness and devo -\\ntion of his second wife.\\nIn June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveil -\\ning of the monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was \\nreceived with extraordinary demonstrations of love and \\nhonour.\\nA few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to \\nthe grave by a vast multitude of mourners, who ‘gave the \\nhapless man the funeral of a king.’ He is still probably the \\nmost widely read writer in Russia.\\nIn the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the \\nfeeling inspired by Dostoevsky: ‘He was one of ourselves, a \\nman of our blood and our bone, but one who has suffered \\nand has seen so much more deeply than we have his insight \\nimpresses us as wisdom … that wisdom of the heart which \\nwe seek that we may learn from it how to live.

But his \\nsleep had not refreshed him; he waked up bilious, ir -\\nritable, ill-tempered, and looked with hatred at his room. \\nIt was a tiny cupboard of a room about six paces in length. \\nIt had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty yellow \\npaper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that \\na man of more than average height was ill at ease in it and \\nfelt every moment that he would knock his head against the \\nceiling. The furniture was in keeping with the room: there \\nwere three old chairs, rather rickety; a painted table in the \\ncorner on which lay a few manuscripts and books; the dust \\nthat lay thick upon them showed that they had been long \\nuntouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole \\nof one wall and half the floor space of the room; it was once \\ncovered with chintz, but was now in rags and served Ras -\\nkolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep on it, as he was, \\nwithout undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old \\nstudent’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under \\nwhich he heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by \\nway of a bolster. A little table stood in front of the sofa.\\nIt would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of \\ndisorder, but to Raskolnikov in his present state of mind \\nthis was positively agreeable. He had got completely away \\nfrom everyone, like a tortoise in its shell, and even the sight '"

But, \\nseeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, \\nand opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the \\ndark entry, which was partitioned off from the tiny kitch -\\nen. The old woman stood facing him in silence and looking \\ninquiringly at him. She was a diminutive, withered up old \\nwoman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp lit -\\ntle nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly \\nsmeared with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it.

The furniture, all very old \\nand of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent \\nwooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-\\ntable with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, \\nchairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in \\nyellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in \\ntheir hands—that was all.
